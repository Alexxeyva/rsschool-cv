## Summary:
---------------

To begin with , My name is Aleksey.
I lead an active lifestyle, read educational books and travel a lot.
First of all, I appreciate sincerity in other people.
Moreover, I obtain a real inspiration from people  with tender hearts as well as from creativity in the world around.
It also means a creative approach to things, the search for various not always standard ways for solving problems that can be implement not only in programming.
I have just thought about studying of Frond-End Development, till I had the opportunity provided by your school.
My main goal is not only preparation for further employment, but also the development of the existential mass and broadening of horizons. After all, programming is an incredibly creative process that, like magic, serves to create, change and order the surrounding space.
Of course , I understand that one short-term course at your school isn't enough, but it gives me perfect motivation and basis for further personal development.
So, I really want to develop and study in this area in the nearest future. I find this as a necessary condition for success in any field.
